# Codex Skills System Setup Completion

> Historical scope note: this report validated the original 15-skill setup.
> The current inventory is extended by
> `codex-loop-runtime-skill-extension-completion.md`.

Phase ID: `codex-skills-system-setup`

## Outcome

The repository-scoped Codex instruction and skill system is installed for this
checkout. This phase changes documentation and Codex metadata only; it does not
change application behavior.

Release gate: `PASS` for the setup phase.

## Files Created

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/planning/phases/codex-skills-system-setup-plan.md`
- `docs/planning/phases/codex-skills-system-setup-completion.md`
- Fifteen `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` files listed below.

## Files Updated

None. The permitted instruction, skill, and phase-document paths did not exist in
this checkout before the phase.

## Skills Created

- `daarion-phase-planner`
- `daarion-repository-auditor`
- `daarion-cross-repo-contracts`
- `daarion-rust-tauri`
- `daarion-local-llm`
- `daarion-agent-runtime`
- `daarion-memory`
- `daarion-tool-security`
- `daarion-identity-crypto`
- `daarion-reticulum-lxmf`
- `daarion-supabase-contracts`
- `daarion-testing`
- `daarion-security-review`
- `daarion-documentation`
- `daarion-release-gate`

The same skill names and contents are mirrored in `daarion-edge-client` so a
session started in either sibling repository sees consistent workflow semantics.
The root `AGENTS.md` remains repository-specific and activates only relevant
domain skills.

## Validation Commands

The following read-only checks were run from repository roots:

```text
find .agents/skills -name SKILL.md -type f | sort
ruby -ryaml -rjson -e '<parse front matter; validate names, descriptions, references, scope, whitespace, and sensitive patterns>'
rg -o '\$daarion-[a-z0-9-]+' AGENTS.md | sort -u
diff -qr .agents/skills ../daarion-edge-client/.agents/skills
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
git status --short
```

A separate fresh process was also run in the edge repository:

```text
codex exec --ephemeral --sandbox read-only '<list instruction sources and skills; simulate Local-only inference policy and InferenceProvider foundation>'
```

## Validation Results

- Front matter: `PASS`; all 15 files contain parseable `name` and `description`
  fields.
- Names: `PASS`; 15 expected names, 15 unique names, and every name matches its
  directory.
- Trigger descriptions: `PASS`; all 15 use explicit scope-oriented trigger text.
- Root references: `PASS`; every referenced skill resolves and every required
  product-layer skill is referenced.
- Mirroring: `PASS`; both skill trees are identical.
- Change scope: `PASS`; only root instructions, skill files, and the two phase
  documents were added.
- Whitespace/final-newline checks: `PASS`.
- Sensitive-content scan: `PASS`; no credential-shaped value, private-key block,
  machine-specific absolute path, or live infrastructure evidence was added.
- Fresh-session discovery: `PASS` in `daarion-edge-client`; the process loaded the
  root instructions and found all 15 repository skills.
- Phase-selection simulation: `PASS`; it selected the required planner,
  local-LLM, testing, security-review, documentation, and release-gate skills,
  plus `daarion-rust-tauri` and `daarion-tool-security` based on the existing
  native inference and network boundary.
- Application lint, build, Rust tests, and frontend tests: not run because this
  phase changed no application, manifest, dependency, migration, or build file.

## Security Review

No confirmed critical or high-severity finding was introduced by this
documentation/metadata-only diff. The new rules fail closed on silent remote
inference, unrestricted tools, privileged pairing payloads, direct LLM key access,
unreviewed migrations, automatic deployment, and unsupported completion claims.

## Limitations

- `Архітектура агента на Reticulum.txt` was not found in the accessible workspace,
  so it was not treated as architecture evidence. It must be reviewed separately
  before it can add or override a transport decision.
- The fresh-process check was run once in `daarion-edge-client`, not repeated in
  this repository. Static validation covers both identical skill trees.
- Fresh Codex startup emitted configured remote-plugin authentication/sync
  warnings before the local read-only audit. Skill discovery still completed and
  the repository files were not changed by that process.
- The new files remain untracked until an explicitly authorized commit or pull
  request is created.

## External Skills

No untrusted or third-party skill was copied or installed. The existing Supabase
skill was consulted for current security-review principles, but no external skill
content was vendored. Random marketplace skills were rejected as unnecessary for
this controlled repository-scoped system.

## Recommended First Development Phase

After the sovereign-agent baseline audit is complete and human-reviewed, begin in
`daarion-edge-client` with **Local-only inference policy and InferenceProvider
foundation**. Use:

- `$daarion-phase-planner`
- `$daarion-local-llm`
- `$daarion-rust-tauri`
- `$daarion-tool-security`
- `$daarion-testing`
- `$daarion-security-review`
- `$daarion-documentation`
- `$daarion-release-gate`

The phase should define a fail-closed execution policy, introduce the provider
boundary with an Ollama adapter, eliminate or explicitly gate simulated remote
success, and add policy/egress/failure tests. Memory, Agent Supervisor,
Reticulum/LXMF, wallet, worker, model download, and web changes are explicit
non-goals. Until the baseline audit has completed human review, the implementation
verdict is `NO_GO`; audit and planning may continue.
